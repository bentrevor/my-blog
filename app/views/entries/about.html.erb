<h2>About this blog</h2>
  <p>This blog started out as a practice app and now serves as my personal reflection during my novice apprenticeship at <a href="8thlight.com">8th Light</a>.  According to my mentor, "Topics are wide open - just pour out what you feel but try to stay professional."</p>

  <p>I needed a clever play on words for my title, so I turned to Ricky from Trailer Park Boys.  Other titles I considered were:  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Worst Case Ontario</li>
    <li>Supply and Command</li>
    <li>Survival of the Fitness</li>
    <li>Denial and Error</li>
    <li>It doesn't take rocket appliances</li>
    <li>Do you have a search warranty?</li>
    <li>Basically Peach and Cake</li>
    <li>I'm not a pessimist, I'm an optometrist</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It would have been "One Knee Equals Two Feet", but that's already the title of one of John Madden's books.</p>
